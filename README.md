autoencoder
===========

Multi-layer neural network so far.
backprop and sigmoid function. Still working out bugs, but it can learn XOR (which is non linaer).

Next to add is:
1. gradient checking:

2. batch learning
might need to restructure for this to work.

3. more tests around multi-layer stuff working

4. error tracking for a test set during training

then will get to auto-encoding. :)
